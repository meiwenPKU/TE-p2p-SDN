This is a flow-level simulator for simulating the SDN interconnection Traffic Engineering (SDNi-TE)  protocol. This simulator is based on Yen's k-shortest path algorithm and the corresponding implementation <http:
//thinkingscale.com/k-shortest-paths-cpp-version/>, and use BRITE to generate the top-down hierarchical topologies.
